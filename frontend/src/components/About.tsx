                        From a young age, I have been intrinsically fascinated
                        and inspired by technology, awe-struck by its almost
                        limitless potential for creativity, entertainment,
                        sharing, and problem solving. I began programming in
                        Java around the age of 14 but really caught the bug in
                        my highschool days after taking an AP computer science
                        class in Java. I knew software engineering was my
                        calling once I realized that I was genuinely excited to
                        be going to school, something that I hadn't been used to
                        since Kindergarten. Quickly, I found myself staying up
                        late recreating games such as tetris, snake, tron,
                        hang-man, ultimate tic tac toe, and flappy bird as a
                        form of enjoyment. When my Pre-Calc teacher told our
                        class we would need graphing calculators, I refused to
                        spend money when I could just code one myself.

                        However, a certain pandemic forced me to reconsider how
                        I was spending my finances and instead of continuing my

                        which would teach me many of the latest and most
                        in-demand skills for software engineers. Springboard
                        offered a job guarantee after graduating or they would
                        refund my payment. I began working my first real
                        software engineering job with FACTORFIVE Skincare, a
                        local Chico business focused on creating stem cell
